  ### I look for any un-solved porblems or examine new prospective of solved ones to

  design and present applications. These applications should predict, evaluate and eventually render
  
  value for end-users. My passions are learning and training. 
  
  My family are the most important thing in the world.  Traveling, watching classical or international movies, reading social and political articles/books and 
  
  workout are items that I do my best to accomodate them in my life
